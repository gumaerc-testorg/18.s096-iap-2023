  "course_description": "We all know that calculus courses such as [*18.01 Single Variable Calculus*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/) and [*18.02 Multivariable Calculus*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/) cover univariate and vector calculus, respectively. Modern applications such as machine learning and large-scale optimization require the next big step, \"matrix calculus\" and calculus on arbitrary vector spaces.\n\nThis class covers a coherent approach to matrix calculus showing techniques that allow you to think of a matrix holistically (not just as an array of scalars), generalize and compute derivatives of important matrix factorizations and many other complicated-looking operations, and understand how differentiation formulas must be re-imagined in large-scale computing.",
